	<p>Line follower is an autonomous robot which follows either black line in white are or white line in black area. Robot must be able to detect particular line and keep following it.For special situations such as cross overs where robot can have more than one path which can be followed, predefined path must be followed by the robot.</p>

<h3>STUDENT PORTFOLIO</h3>
	<span id = "first">

	<span id = "second">
	<p>The challenge is designing a portfolio program that works, one that truly impacts teaching and learning in such a way that ultimately transforms the static, mechanical, disengaging moments when learning stops and testing begins into a continuum of moments combining assessment, instruction, and learning. This is the promise of an effective portfolio assessment program. No doubt it takes time, but in almost every case, it is time well spent.</p>
